# Hi, I'm Denzel

I'm a Business Analytics and Information Systems graduate from the University of Auckland, passionate about turning data into clear, actionable business insights. 

I'm someone who's always been drawn to the space where business thinking and technology meet. I like that data isn't just numbers; it's the story behind decisions, and I enjoy being the person who helps make that story clear.

I started university studying Film and Communications at Victoria University of Wellington, which gave me a strong foundation in storytelling and communication before I pivoted into analytics. I think that background still shapes how I approach data work. I'm always thinking about how to communicate findings in a way that actually lands with people, not just technically, but meaningfully.

Outside of work I'm involved in my local Catholic community, which keeps me grounded and connected to something bigger than myself. I'm also a big sports and fitness person, and I still love film — so you'll often find me at the gym, at church, or rewatching something I've already seen three times.

I'm collaborative by nature. I do my best work alongside people, not just for them.
