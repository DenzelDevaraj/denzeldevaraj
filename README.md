# Hi, I'm Denzel

I'm a Business Analytics and Information Systems graduate from the University of Auckland. I'll be honest — I stumbled into analytics. I started university studying Film and Communications at Victoria University of Wellington, drawn to storytelling and how ideas are communicated. I didn't plan to end up working with data.

But somewhere along the way, it clicked. I realised that analytics is storytelling, just with different raw material. The same instinct that makes you want to understand why a film works, why a scene lands, why an audience feels something — that same curiosity transfers remarkably well to asking why a trend is emerging, why a number looks wrong, or what a dataset is actually trying to tell you. That foundation in storytelling and communication still shapes everything about how I approach data work. I don't just want to find the insight; I want to communicate it in a way that actually lands with people.

I'm detail-oriented and I care about getting things right, not just getting them done. Outside of work I'm active in my local Catholic community, watch F1 and work out, and still love film and music, things that keep me grounded and remind me there's more to life than a pivot table.
